# Exercise_Mandelbrot
Generation of the Mandelbrot set

This Python code calculates the Mandelbrot set. 

Description of the variables:
n_max: the number of itteration of the 'test' function before concluding on the appartenance (or not) of a point to the set.
res: resolution of the generated picture. 
c_min / c_max: the plot range of the picture for the x-axis. There is a 0.5 gap for the y-axis

An increase in n_max or res will improve the quality of the output but can substantially increase the calculation time.

Example of output generated with the following variable values:
n_max=10 
res=10000 
c_min =-2 
c_max = 2
